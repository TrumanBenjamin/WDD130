            <p>There are many reasons why monkeys love bananas. The most obvious among these being that they grow in the areas where monkeys live-
                in hot, tropical areas. However, these bananas are not the same as the traditional yellow banana that humans are used to. The "Cavendish" 
                banana that humans are most acquainted with is far sweeter than the bananas that grow in the wild. Many species of monkeys prefer a diet that is 
                high in fiber. As well as bananas, they are known to eat eggs, nuts, seeds and fruits!  </p>

                Finally, to address in full the most pressing matter at hand, the question of- "why do monkeys love bananas?" I have one answer. It is this: 
                monkeys love bananas because society has made them (and us!) think they do... Let me explain. In a study conducted by Primates Park it was found that 
                "wild monkeys never face bananas, unless they are surrounded by human habitation- where the bananas are or have been planted." In a survey of 936 monkeys, 
                it was found that monkeys often preferred other fruits, vegetables or nuts before bananas. In fact, the "Cavendish" banana discussed
                in the paragraph above is very often not even permitted in zoos where monkeys live, because of how sweet the banana is. So, we learn here that yet another common 
                belief is proven to be, to the chagrin of many, a fallacy. To those who feel hurt by this news- I weep with you. Perhaps you can find solace in reflecting on the sentiment 
                that we as humans aspire for the truth, but oftentimes know not where to find it. If this thought piques your interest in any way and makes you question what you know to be true, I'd suggest checking out a website
                that is chalk-full of truth and void of any fallacies- <a class="church" href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org">churchofjesuschrist.org.</a>
